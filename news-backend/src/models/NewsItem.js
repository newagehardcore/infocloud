/*
Defines the intended structure for documents in the 'newsitems' collection.
This is not a Mongoose schema, but a reference for the data structure.
Validation should be handled in the service layer before database operations.

{
  id: String,         // Unique identifier for the news item (e.g., from source API or generated hash)
  title: String,        // Required: Headline of the news item
  description: String,  // Optional: A short summary or description
  url: String,          // Required: Direct URL to the original news article
  source: {
    name: String,     // Required: Name of the news source (e.g., "New York Times", "NewsAPI")
    bias: String      // Required: Political bias rating (e.g., "Left", "Center", "Right")
  },
  publishedAt: Date,    // Required: Original publication date/time
  category: String,     // Required: News category (e.g., "Politics", "Technology", "World")
  keywords: [String],   // Array of keywords extracted from the title/description
  topic: String,        // Optional: Main topic determined by LLM analysis
  sentiment: String,    // Optional: Sentiment score/label determined by LLM analysis
  createdAt: Date       // Timestamp when the item was added to our database (defaults to now)
}
*/

// No code needed here if not using an ORM like Mongoose.
// The structure is defined in the comment above.
// We will interact with the 'newsitems' collection directly via the driver.

module.exports = {}; // Export empty object or potentially validation functions later
